		energy_spectra

Takes a cross-correlation function table and writes multiple energy spectra from it (per 
phase bin).

CONTENTS:

energyspec.py -- Takes CCF amplitudes of a specific time bin and writes them to a file.

mean_spectrum.sh -- Makes a spectrum from all the event-mode data files for a propID. Use this over mean_spectrum.PY.

run_energyspec.sh -- Bash script to run energyspec.py.
