# energy_spectra

Takes a two-dimensional cross correlation function (CCF) and writes multiple 
spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from it (per specified phase bin). Fits 
multiple SEDs simultaneously with XSPEC, and fits a function to those SED 
parameter variations.

## Contents

### energyspec.py
Takes CCF amplitudes of a specific time bin and writes them to a file. Can make
only a mean SED (of just the mean count rate per channel of interest), mean \+ 
ccf for a phase-resolved SED, or only the ccf for a deviation of each phase-
resolved SEDs from the mean SED. Units should be photon count rate.

### run_energyspec.sh
Bash script to run energyspec.py and make and run XSPEC scripts to make plots of
the SEDs.

### spectra/ccfonly.pco
A QDP style file for plotting the ccf deviations with stepped lines.

### spectra/ccfonly_points.pco
A QDP style file for plotting the ccf deviations with unconnected points.

### spectra/ccfwmean.pco
A QDP style file for plotting the mean+ccf (i.e. phase-resolved SED) with 
stepped lines.

### spectra/ccfwmean_points.pco
A QDP style file for plotting the mean+ccf (i.e. phase-resolved SED) with 
unconnected points.

### sed_fitting.sh
Simultaneously fits multiple energy spectra (SEDs) from different points in the 
QPO phase. Makes the phase-resolved energy spectra, writes the xspec script, 
runs the xspec script, outputs to a log file.

### multifit_plots.py
Reads the xspec log file to plot how the untied SED parameters change with QPO 
phase. Fits the changing parameters with a function and gets the 'phase' of 
each parameter variation.
